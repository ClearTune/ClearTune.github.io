## Abstract
Accurate indoor pedestrian positioning has attracted extensive research attention along with the rising popularity of indoor location-based service. Among the indoor positioning methods, pedestrian dead reckoning stands out for requiring neither expensive infrastructure nor laborious site survey. However, with time going on, the pedestrian dead reckoning method suffers from error accumulation problem, whereas the major cause of positioning error is usually heading deviation. To tackle the error-drifting problem, an FM-aided heuristic drift reduction method for pedestrian dead reckoning systems is designed and evaluate in this paper. First a random forest classifier is devised to achieve real-time recognition of straight-line and turning motion mode with data from frequency-modulated radio signal and inerital sensor signal. Based on the classification result, constraint is applied to headings in straight periods and accurate headings are extracted from accelerometer and magnetometer measurements to reduce heading deviation in straight periods. Field experiments have been conducted at three sites in two office buildings to evaluate the performance of the proposed system. Experiment results indicate error drifting can be effectively constrained by the proposed method.
