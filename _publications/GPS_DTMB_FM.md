## Abstract
Global Positiong System (GPS) yields good precision and availability in open outdoor environment. However, the errors of GPS may suffer degradation in some complex environment, such as forests and urban canyons. To solve this problem, a new positioning method is designed integrating GPS, Digital Terrestrial Multimedia Broadcast (DTMB) and frequency-modulated (FM) radio signal. In this method, the DTMB transmitter acts as a pseudo-satellite to assist GPS positioning. Furthermore, the FM fingerprint positioning is used to correct the positioning bias. An adaptive selection scheme is proposed to provide an optimal integration mode of the sensors. Field experiments in complex environment have been carried out for evaluation. Comparing to the GPS-only and GPS+DTMB approach, positioning accuracy is improved by at least 68.21% and 21.27% with the proposed method.
