## Abstract
Global Positiong System (GPS) yields good precision and availability in open outdoor environment, whereas its accuracy often suffers serious degradation in complex environment like forests and urban canyons due to occlusion, attenuation and multipath. In order to improve positioning accuracy in such complex environment, a positioning method is designed and tested integrating GPS, Digital Terrestrial Multimedia Broadcast (DTMB) and frequency-modulated (FM) radio signal with an adaptive integration mode selection scheme. Major contributions of this paper lie in two aspects. Firstly, the DTMB transmitter is taken as a pseudo-satellite to assist GPS positioning, and positioning result of FM signal fingerprinting is used to correct location yields of the GPS+DTMB system. Secondly, an adaptive integration mode selection scheme is devised to decide the optimal integration mode of GPS, DTMB and FM positioning according to environmental conditions. Field experiment proves that accuracy of the proposed positioning method outperforms those of GPS-only and GPS+DTMB approach in complex environment.
